I understand! You want to build a multitenant event booking platform step by step, starting with the most basic components first. Let me break down the implementation plan into very basic, incremental steps without building anything yet.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for BookItPro

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Initialize Node.js/Express backend
   - Set up basic folder structure
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up basic database connection

2. **Database Schema Design**
   - Design basic user table
   - Design tenant/organizer table
   - Design events table
   - Design bookings table

### **Phase 2: Basic Authentication**
3. **User Registration & Login**
   - Simple user registration endpoint
   - Basic login with JWT tokens
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Basic logout functionality

4. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Define user roles (Admin, Manager, Attendee)
   - Middleware for role checking
   - Basic route protection

### **Phase 3: Single Tenant System**
5. **Basic Event Management**
   - Create event endpoint (single tenant)
   - Read/Update/Delete events
   - Basic event listing

6. **Basic Booking System**
   - Book event endpoint
   - View user bookings
   - Cancel booking functionality
   - Basic capacity checking

### **Phase 4: Multi-Tenant Implementation**
7. **Tenant Isolation**
   - Implement tenant-based data filtering
   - Tenant context middleware
   - Database queries scoped to tenant

8. **Organizer Registration**
   - Organizer registration flow
   - Tenant creation process
   - Organizer login with tenant context

### **Phase 5: Advanced Features**
9. **Enhanced Event Management**
   - Event types (hackathon, webinar, concert)
   - Advanced event properties
   - Event search and filtering

10. **Advanced Booking Features**
    - Overbooking prevention
    - Booking status management
    - Booking history and analytics

### **Phase 6: Frontend & Polish**

12. **UI/UX Improvements**
    - Better styling
    - Responsive design
    - User experience enhancements

## **What We'll Build First (Next Steps):**

**Step 1: Basic Project Setup**
- Initialize Node.js project
- Install basic dependencies (Express, bcrypt, JWT, etc.)
- Create basic folder structure
- Set up database connection

**Step 2: Simple User Authentication**
- User registration endpoint
- User login endpoint
- Basic JWT token generation
- Simple logout

**Step 3: Basic Database Models**
- User model
- Simple event model (single tenant)
- Basic booking model

Would you like me to start with **Step 1: Basic Project Setup**? This will involve:
- Creating package.json
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up basic Express server
- Creating folder structure
- Database connection setup
